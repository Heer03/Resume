In my Freshman year, I completed general chemistry (CHM 110), and joined Academic Advancement Center as a Chemistry tutor in the following semester. My experience as a tutor there is awesome and has motivated me to not leave the opportunity. As a tutor, on an average, I help around 15 students in a week. This includes helping them in understanding some concepts, HW help, or help with using softwares like excel and word for Chemistry lab. It has taught me good communication skills and has also helped me develop abilities in which I can convey my point to others in an effective and friendly manner. It was quite a happy moment when I was declared the tutor of the month for November 2022 and this also motivated me to continue what I am doing.This job has taught me how to properly manage my time while constantly switching between work and studies.

In addition to that, in my sophomore year, I took the position of a grader for Graphical communication class (EGR 120). This class basically involves introductory knowledge to CATIA V5- starting with part modelling, including drawings and ending with assemblies and 3d printing. As a grader, I have to be present in class and assist them during the lecture. Outside of that, I grade homework assignments and help students with some concepts if needed. Apart from time management, this job has helped me become more responsible towards my work. Adding to that, it also benifits me by strengthning my CAD skills.
